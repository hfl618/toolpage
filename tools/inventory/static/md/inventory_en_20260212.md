# Inventory Management System - User Guide

## 1. Core Modules
- **Component Library**: A centralized digital index for all your hardware. Store names, models, footprints, and specifications.
- **Smart BOM Parsing**: Upload your BOM in Excel/CSV format. The system automatically matches existing parts and highlights missing components.
- **Stock Workflow**:
  - `Stock In`: Increase inventory for specific batches.
  - `Stock Out`: Deduct stock based on project requirements.
  - `Alerts`: Parts with stock below the threshold will be highlighted in red.

## 2. Digital Features
- **QR Code System**: Generate unique QR codes for every part. Scan with any mobile device to jump directly to the management page.
- **Location Hierarchy**: Manage parts using a "Warehouse - Shelf - Bin" structure for precise physical tracking.
- **Exporting**: Export your entire inventory list to a standard Excel file for manual auditing or offline records.

## 3. Pro Tips
- **Smart Search**: Use fuzzy matching. Type "10k 0603" to quickly find the exact resistor you need.
- **Bulk Actions**: In the BOM parser, select multiple items to sync them to your project workspace in one click.
- **Visuals**: Upload real photos for complex ICs to ensure the correct parts are picked during assembly.
